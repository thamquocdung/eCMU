Our implementation was developed based on the [`sdx23-aimless`](https://github.com/aim-qmul/sdx23-aimless.git) framework.
## Abstract
From our baseline [Open-Unmix](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch) (UMX), we:
- Attempt to build an affordable model to solve the music source separation (MSS) task in the spectral domain with limited computing resources.
- Apply a differentiable Multi-channel Wiener Filter (MWF) into a mask-based prediction model to end-to-end estimated the complex spectrogram for each source.
- Optimize the model by using the Multi-domain loss function on the public [`MUSDB18-HQ`](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-hq-uncompressed-wav) dataset.
- Leverage the ability of Conformer blocks to capture both local and global feature dependencies on time and frequency axis.
