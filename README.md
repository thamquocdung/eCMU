Our implementation was developed based on the [`sdx23-aimless`](https://github.com/aim-qmul/sdx23-aimless.git) framework.

## Abstract
From our baseline [Open-Unmix](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch) (UMX), we:
- Attempt to build an affordable model to solve the music source separation (MSS) task in the spectral domain with limited computing resources.
- Apply a differentiable Multi-channel Wiener Filter (MWF) into a mask-based prediction model to end-to-end estimated the complex spectrogram for each source.
- Optimize the model by using the Multi-domain loss function on the public [`MUSDB18-HQ`](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#musdb18-hq-uncompressed-wav) dataset.
- Leverage the ability of Conformer blocks to capture both local and global feature dependencies on time and frequency axis.

## Installation
- python 3.8+
- pytorch-lightning
- pytorch

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## Getting Started
_Note: eCMU is a single-target model. This means each stem is separated by a specific model. Therefore, there are four single models in total._
- Download model weight at ...
- To separate **all sources** on `gpu`:
```bash
python -m core.models.separator 
    assets/samples/22_TaylorSwift.mp3  
    --model_ckpt ckpt_path/
```

- To separate **all sources** on `cpu`:
```bash
python -m core.models.separator 
    assets/samples/22_TaylorSwift.mp3  
    --model_ckpt ckpt_path/ 
    --no-gpu
```
- Or, even if you want to separte a **subset of stems** (i.e: only {`vocals`, `drums`}), you can run:
```bash
python -m core.models.separator 
    assets/samples/22_TaylorSwift.mp3  
    --targets vocals drums
    --model_ckpt ckpt_path/ 
```
Other audio formats: `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aac` are also supported.
## Training
```bash
python main.py fit --config cfg/vocals.yaml
# python main.py fit --config cfg/drums.yaml
# python main.py fit --config cfg/bass.yaml
# python main.py fit --config cfg/other.yaml
```

Look into the `.yaml` files, if you want to modify hyper-parameters, training arguments, data pipeline,...
